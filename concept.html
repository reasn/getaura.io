            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>Imagine Aura like a shining light around you. It’s only visible to other Aura users and you can change
                it to express your feelings, ideas and more.<br/>
                After downloading it the first thing you do is to choose your Aura's color. Next you chose a
                cause or idea that you feel for.<br/>
                And that’s it - your Aura shines and stays with you wherever you
                guy. Of course you can disable it any time!
                But luckily Aura has no perceivable impact on your battery and it’s power consumption is below 1% per
                day.<br/>
                There's nothing like Aura and people will probably use it creative, unexpected ways.
                So far, Aura was built with a few scenarios in mind:</p>
            <h3>Wearing data is self-expression</h3>
            <p>Do you have causes that are important to you? A statement like #refugeeswelcome, the latest track from
                your totally unknown favorite artist or a crowdsourcing campaign to help a friend: What’s important to
                you is part of your personality and Aura allows you to share it wherever you go. It’s like a bumper
                sticker, button or ribbon. Just infinitely easier to change. And more impactful - other Aura users will
                spread your idea if they feel the same. Ever wondered what moves the people you share the morning bus or
                subway with? Aura is a window into the invisible world of ideas and thoughts of the people around
                you.</p>
            <h3>Dissidents in countries with state-controlled internet</h3>
            <p>In many regards information technology has shifted the balance of power between states and individuals
                towards more surveillance and control. The driving trends for this are automation and centralization.
                Aura attempts to shift this balance at least slightly back towards individual freedom. When the internet
                is not freely accessible, Aura allows an unfiltered, unblockable way of sharing (political) messages
                with people nearby. This allows for data grafitti: Use Aura to put your thoughts and ideas on an old
                phone and put put it into a crowded place. Other users will see the Aura without being able to see where
                exactly it is.</p>
            <p>It becomes really powerful when crowds are protesting. Even with full internet surveillance and shut down
                GSM/LTE signals, Aura allows to quickly pass messages, coordinate and share unblockable ideas.</p>
            <h3>Stay in touch with your group on (music) festivals</h3>
            <p>It's quite easy to get lost on large music festivals without proper phone signal.
                Waiting back at the camp can be as annoying as wandering stage after stage for hours.
                If your friends have Aura you can find them again pretty easily.
                Simply agree that all of you post their next acts or when they meet at camp. Later, when dancing and
                loosing of them, when you end up on the same stage your Auras will touch, your phone vibrates and you
                see what they're up to. This way you can move from stage to stage much more freely while staying
                connected.
            </p>
            <h3>A word about Privacy and Self-expression</h3>
            <p>At no point is your data sent to us or anybody else over the internet. The privacy-concerned can use Aura
                on a blank phone without SIM card. Others will link their instagram account to express themselves.</p>
