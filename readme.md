### Aura is a network to spread ideas and change the world.

## [Have Android? Join the Alpha!](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.auraapp.auraandroid)

> Show your digital aura wherever you like. No censorship, no control.

### Your Aura is with you
* Your Aura consists of a few ideas that you hold dear.
* When another user is in proximity, they can see your ideas. And you see theirs, of course.

### Aura wants to be the first unblockable social network
* Today's social networks transmit your most private data over the internet.
* Transmission is encrypted but owners and governments have access.
* The safest way to keep information private is to not transmit it over a network.
* Aura transmits data directly from phone to phone
* No network operator or government can shut it down, it requires no network and no internet
* No registration, nobody stores data about you
* Because it doesn't need a network, you could run Aura on an old phone without wifi and SIM card. 

## How does it work?
* It creates a digital Aura around you \(20-100m\)
* Your Aura consists of the ideas that you decide to share
* Other users can see it
* Your personal aura consists of text and emojis \(more to come!\)
* Aura needs no internet for that. It works in the 🚇, on 🚂, in the 🏔, aboard 🛳, on the surface of 🌔, flying a ✈ or anywhere in the 🌌.
* You can turn it off time.
* There are no servers and no data is collected.

## Why do I want Aura?
* Humans wore clothes and accessories for millennia. Get Aura and wear data! 
* Meet interesting people
* Anonymously share gossip and buzz
* Safely coordinate street protests in countries with full internet surveillance
