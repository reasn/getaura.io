# Aura

> Show your digital aura wherever you like. Take back your privacy.

### A social network around you

* Aura is an app that allows you to maintain a short social profile on your phone.
* Other Aura users around you can see it \(and you can see their profiles, of course\)

### Spread thoughts

* Your Aura also has up to three thoughts, short messages that you consider important
* Others can quickly spread them by making them part of their Aura

### No servers, no internet, no SIM card required

* Aura transmits data directly from phone to phone
* No network operator or government can shut it down, it requires no network and no internet
* No registration, nobody stores data about you
* Factory-reset an old phone, install Aura. Now you have your fully anonymous digital Aura

## How does it work?

* Aura creates a digital aura around you \(20-100m\)
* Only people with the app can see your Aura
* Your personal aura consists of text and emojis \(more to come!\)
* Aura needs no internet for that. It works
  * 🚇 in the subway
  * 🚂 on trains
  * 🏔 on Mount Everest
  * 🛳 on ships
  * 🌔 on Mars
  * ✈ in planes
  * 🏜 in the desert
  * 🌌 anywhere in the galaxy
* Aura lets you quickly create and spread thoughts

## Why do I want Aura?

* Express yourself by adding a digital aura to your personality
* See auras around you and start talking if you feel like
* Anonymously share gossip and buzz
* Safely coordinate street protests in countries with full internet surveillance

## Private. Like nothing else.

* Nobody who is more than 100m away from you can even see that you use Aura
* Aura needs no server or infrastructure which may be hacked
* Any bad guy would have to be nearby to intercept messages
* If you tend to paranoia
  * Go to flight mode or eat your SIM card
  * You can still use Aura
