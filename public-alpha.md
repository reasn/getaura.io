# Public Alpha

Please follow these simple steps

1. Be aware that it's an alpha version. That means it's not finished and likely to crash or behave weirdly
2. Install it \(links below\) and test it \(ideally together with other testers\)
3. Provide feedback using the [Aura Feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/wf1n5uJb2u9Io4x93).
4. Thank you ðŸ˜€

The most convenient way to test the app and receive updates is to get it from Google Play:

### [Download Aura in Google Play...](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.auraapp.auraandroid)

Alternatively you can manually [download and install the signed APK](/downloads.md) \(not recommended! You won't receive updates and fixes for bugs\).
